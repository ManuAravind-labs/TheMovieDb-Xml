This sends the mother, Lisle, on a reverie of her relationship with her older sister, Aurora, when they were kids and their mother was dying. Flashbacks show the contrasting reactions of the two girls, Aurora's anger and Lisle's innocent determination to find her mother. The boy's questions also prompt Lisle to visit Aurora and to tell her a story.
